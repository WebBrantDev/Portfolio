						My name is Brant Smith and I am a burgeoning web developer with a

					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>
						I am currently enrolled in the Engineering Flex program at Thinkful with aims to master full stack
						engineering. Being a part of this program will give me the opportunity to collaborate with others and learn
						from my
						peers. Having primarily done self-learning for the past few years, I am looking forward to the benefits of
						working
						with others. I have always had an interest in computers and that interest has
						finally manifested itself into a real passion for web development.
					</p>

					<h3>Interests:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Challenging myself, both physically and mentally</li>
						<li>Most sports (especially soccer)</li>
						<li>Traveling, whenever possible</li>
						<li>Building computers</li>
						<li>Trying to live more sustainably</li>
